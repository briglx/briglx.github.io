I just reviewed a recorded tech talk I gave a while ago. Here are some suggestions on improving my presentation skills

- Don't laugh at my own jokes.
- [Eliminating Verbal Pauses](http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2005/07/eliminating-verbal-pauses/)
- Have energy even when there are only three people in the meeting
- Have a clear plan
- Make points very very very clear
