I'm going to look into different ways to fulfill the objective of separating user content into different user groups

- Prospect
- Student
- Faculty

## Assumptions

- Prospects can only see prospect data
- Students can only see student and prospects data
- Alumni can see all data

- All users can search the data they have access to
Users can create content in areas they have access to

## Metrics

- License Cost: The cost of Jive license needed.
- Effort to implement: How many developer/qa/deployment hours will be needed
- Conformity: How well does the solution follow Industry and company standards

## Possible Solutions
