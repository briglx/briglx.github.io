I enjoy getting sucked into things that tickle my brain. One such activity is coming up with names for my computers/projects/etc. I've settled on a naming [convension for computers](https://github.com/briglx/computer-name-generator).

Here is a list of some favorites:

- hilltop-wasp
- capeside-grizzly
