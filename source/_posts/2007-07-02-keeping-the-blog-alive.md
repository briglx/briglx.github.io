My daily routine involves reading several different blogs as my way of taking advantage of other people's great ideas. Most of the things that I read are technical, but mix in with the bunch has been a [blog about blogs](http://www.problogger.net/). For the most part many of the articles I read are in essence a variation on the same theme. It is refreshing to find a diamond in the rough article that really helps to clarify an idea or answer a difficult question. I don't expect this post to be a diamond, but I do plan for it to help me stay consistent with delivering my own ideas and experiences. The one piece of advice I've read is to keep a regular schedule of posting and that is what I'll do.
