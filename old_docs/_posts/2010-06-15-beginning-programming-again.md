Learning and New IDE is difficult. 

In Visual Studio and .Net I felt incredible productive. I could focus on solving problems and not having to focus so much time on tinkering with the IDE or the nuance of the Language. IntelliJ and Java are testing my patience. I enjoy learning new technology and I think learning Java will help me as a developer. I just need to get past the learning curve and get into High Productive Mode.
