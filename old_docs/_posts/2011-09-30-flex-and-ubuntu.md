I'm on a project that uses flash for the ui. I want to make a few modification and thought I would try it out. The tutorial ask to install Flash Builder, but I don't want to spend any money for a fancy IDE. I discovered I can just use the SDK. Should be simple enough.

It's just a matter of [downloading the SDK](http://opensource.adobe.com/wiki/display/flexsdk/Download+Flex+4)

Unzipping and adding $FLEX_HOME/bin to the Path
