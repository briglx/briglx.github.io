I meet today about setting the priority of automating standards compliance. These are my notes:

## Purpose

Having a gatekeeper for deployments to production solve Business Problems. Knowing what standards a project follows helps with the deployments

## Priorities

- Ensure Maven is pushing to Artifactory - Releases builds
- Proper Version Number
- Small wins
- QTP Is configured for app

## Accuracy and precision

First pass solutions will be accurate because they are automated, precision will come through iterative releases.
