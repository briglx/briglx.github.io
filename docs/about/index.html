<!-- 
I’m a Cloud Solution Architect for Microsoft. I solve problems by being insatiably curious.

> I believe the best solutions come from understanding the people at the heart of innovation. My expertise is discovering and explaining novel solutions with my rare perspective. 

I have always enjoyed developing software and learning new technologies. I have a love of learning, a love for teaching, and plenty of curiosity to fill a pool.

I’m a hands-on architect who enjoys coding and a passionate learner who quickly understands a vision and works with teams to deliver. I have leadership experience designing and developing product lines and company standards. I’ve been involved in architecting big data solutions to support Adaptive Learning and modeling student knowledge. I’ve lead research projects to operationalize emerging technologies with a published whitepaper in research around MongoDB and a patent pending in the area of Social Classroom Integration and Content Management. I enjoy sharing what I learn and have experience teaching wilderness survival skills. I was also a leader and teacher for immersive web development bootcamps where students learned hands-on skills building real world projects.

I hold an MBA and a BS degree in information technology. As a continuous learner, I like to supplements my education with opencoursware from MIT and Stanford.

When I’m not programming or reading something new, you can find me on the slopes following my true passion of skiing.
