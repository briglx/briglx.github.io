I'll be honest. I'm skeptical that the SalesForce platform can effectivly create applications that look and perform on par with custom Java/Web apps build in house. 

I think it may be able to run code all right, it's the UI that I'm not too sure of. Can I really create a completely custom looking app and have it run on the platform? First I'll do the Tutorial, then perhaps I'll try to create the Milage Log app.

I'm impressed. The UI can be completely customized. The framework provides:

- A custom templating engine
- custom mvc framework
- ui controls

I'm not really liking the control based approach. I like [microMvc](http://code.google.com/p/micromvc-asp/) paradigm more
