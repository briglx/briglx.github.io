I have a goal to improve my communication and organization process. One way I thought I could do that is to blog more regularly. One of my first tasks was to find a good code plugin for wordpress so I can highlight code. So here goes. I've decided to use Wordpress because of the large community and plenty of plugins. One plugin I found was the SyntaxHighlighter. It didn't come default with the objective-c language brush so I had to download and install that too. But here is the final result: \[oc\] #import <Foundation/Foundation.h>

@interface LogEntry : NSObject{ NSString \*location; NSDate \*date; NSNumber \*odometer; NSNumber \*gallons; } @property (nonatomic, retain) NSString \*location; @property (nonatomic, retain) NSDate \*date; @property (nonatomic, retain) NSNumber \*odometer; @property (nonatomic, retain) NSNumber \*gallons;

@end\[/oc\]
