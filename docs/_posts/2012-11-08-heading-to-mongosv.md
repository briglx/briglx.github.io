If you don't have your schedule finalized, I'll be speaking on How We Evaluated MongoDB as an Relational Database Replacement at 9:50 am, right after the welcome ceremony at [MongoSV](http://www.10gen.com/events/mongosv).

The conference is December 4th from 8:00 am - 8:00 pm. I'll explain the process, methodology, and results used to evaluated MongoDB to replace Oracle for a core platform component.
