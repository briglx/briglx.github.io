I just had the engine light come on the 4Runner. Looking around here is what I found. Fortunately for me, my transmission fluid level was low. Adding a little fluid fixed the problem.

### Background

- The PO770 error code is for the lock up clutch in the converter.
- It is called a Shift Solenoid "E" malfunction
- The computer commanded (the clutch: on) by way of the (solenoid E) and it did not respond.
- Shift solenoid valve 'E' is turned ON or OFF by the Transmission Control Module (TCM) in response to signals sent from the park/neutral position (PNP) switch, vehicle speed and Engine Control Module (ECM) (throttle opening). Gears will then be shifted to the optimum position.
- This is usually a bad (sticking) solenoid, but can also be a bad torque converter.
- We have a 2001 4Runner. This falls into the 1996-2002 Toyota 4Runner 5ZE-FE
- A340F are found in 4wd 4runners and trucks that have the 2.4L 22RE 4cyl motors.

### Diagnose and Fixes

1. Check the transmission fluid level.
2. Flush the tranny-even though you just did, clean the filter, replace the seal
3. Check shift solenoid valve SL operation.
    1. PREPARATION:
        1. Remove the oil pan.
        2. Remove the shift solenoid valve SL.
    2. CHECK:
        1. Applying 490 kPa (5 kgf/cm2, 71 psi) of compressed air, check that the solenoid valve does not leak air.
        2. When battery voltage is supplied to the shift solenoid valve, check that the solenoid valve opens.
    3. OK when:
        1. Solenoid valve does not leak air.
        2. Solenoid valve opens.
    4. If the solenoid is not good, replace it, if OK check valve body
    5. If valve body is Not Good, Repair or replace the valve body.
    6. If Valve body is OK
    7. Replace the torque converter clutch

You may find:

- If the (solenoid) clicks, then it usually ends up being a bad (converter).
- Bad torque converter causes loud clunk when pressing brake or accelerating

### Estimates

- New Solenoid $277.45 from the dealer.
- Used Torque converter  $150
