Getting started with Selenium testing was a little rough. I was trying to solve too many things at once like putting Maven, JUnit, and Selenium into one project and wondering why it wasn't working. So I took a step back on focused on just the selenium piece. I finally found an article that clarify the moving parts and showed that [Selenium RC](http://seleniumhq.org/docs/05_selenium_rc.html#chapter05-reference) is the key piece of the puzzle.
