I've downloaded Windows Live Writer to see how well it will do posting to Blogspot.com, and so far I am very impressed with the interface. One of the features of Live Writer is the ability to select View -> Web Preview. This shows me what the current post will look like using the templates and styles I have set up at Blogspot.
