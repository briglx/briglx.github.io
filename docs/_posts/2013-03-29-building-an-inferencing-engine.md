I'm playing around with the idea of building an [inference engine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inference_engine) for [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/). The idea is to load up some [RDF data](http://www.w3.org/RDF/) and attempt to run queries that use the [ontologies](http://briglamoreaux.wordpress.com/2012/10/26/what-graphs-and-ontologies-mean-to-you/ "What Graphs and Ontologies mean to you") in the RDF for inferencing. For instance, if I have an ontology that defines an `isParentOf` relationship with an inverse relationship of `isChildOf`, the inferencing engine would know those two relationships are inverse. When the data store only has one record that defines

\[code language="xml" gutter="false"\] <AugustCoppola> <isParentOf> <NicolasCage>`

I can get a result from the following query even though this record doesn't exist. \[code language="xml" gutter="false"\] ? <isChildOf> <AugustCoppola>`

Looking briefly into how I could do this, I found the following:

- [Jena](http://jena.apache.org/documentation/inference/index.html)
- [Pellet](http://clarkparsia.com/pellet/)
- [Strategies](http://notes.3kbo.com/)

The trick is to make it happen.
