[![AwsTomcat](images/awstomcat2-e1381951840211.png)](http://briglamoreaux.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/awstomcat2-e1381951840211.png)I just received an email from Amazon concerning proper Security around Tomcat. Here is part of the message:

> You can avoid being vulnerable to attackers by following the below best practices to increase the security of your Tomcat installation:
> 
> 1\. Ensure that the version of Tomcat you are using is up to date and does not have any known or unaddressed security vulnerability. You can find a list of vulnerabilities by version on the Apache Tomcat website at: http://tomcat.apache.org/security.html.
> 
> 2\. If you have enabled administrator or manager user accounts with access to the Tomcat Manager application (managed within the tomcat-users.xml file), ensure they are given appropriately complex passwords and difficult to guess usernames. Additional information regarding configuring access to Tomcat Manager can be found here:

> \* For Tomcat 6.0, see http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/manager-howto.html#Configuring\_Manager\_Application\_Access \* For Tomcat 7.0, see http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/manager-howto.html#Configuring\_Manager\_Application\_Access \* For Tomcat 8.0, see http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.0-doc/manager-howto.html#Configuring\_Manager\_Application\_Access
> 
> 3\. Verify that you are implementing the recommended security guidelines for your Tomcat installation. For some of the later versions, you may find the following guides helpful:
> 
> \* For Tomcat 6.0, see http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/security-manager-howto.html \* For Tomcat 7.0, see http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/security-howto.html \* For Tomcat 8.0, see http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.0-doc/security-howto.html
