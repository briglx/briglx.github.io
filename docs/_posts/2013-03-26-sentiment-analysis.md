I'd like to know a bit more about the tools and techniques around solving sentiment analysis. Here are a few link's I've found. My focus is to use python.

- [Over view at Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis)
- [Text Processing Demo](http://text-processing.com/demo/sentiment/)
- [nltk](http://nltk.org/)
- [nltk trainer](https://github.com/japerk/nltk-trainer)
- [More nltk Trainer](http://nltk-trainer.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)
- [Even more nltk](https://bitbucket.org/japerk/nltk-trainer/src)

Part of training a model is to have humans label the data. Here is a typical use case:

- Download Data
- Present to User
- User marks as positive of negative or nutural
- Similar to Google Moderator
