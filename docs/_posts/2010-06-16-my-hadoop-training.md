Hadoop has been difficult getting into. I just don't have enough linux/java training to help with understanding some of the foundational concepts. However, today I learned some valuable information.

1. hadoop is a umbrella project for serveral other things (hdfs, mapreduce)
2. The program hadoop give me access to hdfs
3. I can use the FSShell (>hadoop fs -ls)

The next step is to now create my own hadoop map/reduce program.
