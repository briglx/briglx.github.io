I've noticed in my own development processes, I tend to emphasize architecture. But there needs to be ballance between each during each sprint.

- Features for the business
- Architecture
- Process
- Improving existing Code

I need to deliver something to the business even if it is not the ideal solution under the covers. I am obligated to update and deliver for the business.
