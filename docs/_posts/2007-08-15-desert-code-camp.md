Thanks to everyone who attended the session I put on at [Desert Code Camp](http://desertcodecamp.com/default.aspx), [Setting up .NET Development Trees](http://desertcodecamp.com/signUp.aspx?session=196). We covered a lot of stuff surrounding S2C (Source to Code), NAnt, NUnit, and CruiseControl.Net. I hope to have the notes and slides from the presentation up here within the next few days. Thanks again for attending. I had a lot of fun presenting despite the minor hiccup of forgetting my power supply.
