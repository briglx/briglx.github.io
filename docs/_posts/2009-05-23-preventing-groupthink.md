Iâ€™ve been looking into the idea of [Groupthink](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupthink#prevent) and found a nice list on preventing it.

From Wikipedia:

1. Leaders should assign each member the role of "critical evaluator". This allows each member to freely air objections and doubts.
2. Higher-ups should not express an opinion when assigning a task to a group.
3. The organization should set up several independent groups, working on the same problem.
4. All effective alternatives should be examined.
5. Each member should discuss the group's ideas with trusted people outside of the group.
6. The group should invite outside experts into meetings. Group members should be allowed to discuss with and question the outside experts.
7. At least one group member should be assigned the role of [Devil's advocate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devil%27s_advocate). This should be a different person for each meeting.
