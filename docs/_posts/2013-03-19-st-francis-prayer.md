This morning I was able to hear a [beautiful prayer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prayer_of_Saint_Francis) at the [East Valley Mayors Prayer Breakfast](http://unitedfoodbank.org/get-involved/events/upcoming-events/evmayorsbreakfast/)

> Lord, make me an instrument of your peace, Where there is hatred, let me sow love; Where there is injury, pardon; Where there is doubt, faith; Where there is despair, hope; Where there is darkness, light; Where there is sadness, joy. O Divine Master, grant that I may not so much seek to be consoled, as to console; to be understood, as to understand; to be loved, as to love. For it is in giving that we receive. It is in pardoning that we are pardoned, and it is in dying that we are born to Eternal Life. Amen.
