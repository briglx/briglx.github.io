I wanted to enabled "Pretty" permalinks for my blog and found it wasn't just a click of the button. 

Well, it was just [a click of a button](http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Permalinks#Using_.22Pretty.22_permalinks) but when I clicked on the button, Wordpress told me: 

> If your `.htaccess` file were writable, we could do this automatically, but it isnâ€™t so these are the `mod_rewrite` rules you should have in your `.htaccess` file.

```xml
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c> 
RewriteEngine On 
RewriteBase /wordpress/ 
RewriteRule ^index.php$ - [L] 
%{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f 
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d 
RewriteRule . /wordpress/index.php [L] 
</IfModule>
```
Honestly I don't know very much about `mod_rewite` but apparently it used the `.htaccess` file found in the Wordpress directory. The only problem is when I check the directory for my blog, `/var/www/wordpress/`, I don't see an `.htaccess` file. 

Poking around the web taught me I should first [configure .htaccess](http://www.joeldare.com/wiki/linux:using_.htaccess_on_ubuntu) for pages under `/var/www/`. Next I just created the file and added the content and restarted apache. I doubled checked [Wordpress documentation](http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Permalinks#Using_.22Pretty.22_permalinks) and verified I did things correctly. Not too bad.
