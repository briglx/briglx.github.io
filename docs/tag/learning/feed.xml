      <content type="html" xml:base="https://www.briglamoreaux.com/2007/07/05/balance-simple-code-and-expert-knowledge.html">&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://odetocode.com/Blogs/scott/archive/2007/07/02/11050.aspx&quot;&gt;What’s Wrong With This Code (#16)&lt;/a&gt; because it got me thinking about having in depth knowledge on a subject and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle&quot;&gt;KISS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I saw the code, I thought it was an overkill for the problem. In the comments I offered a solution that is simple and what seems to have solved the problem. I’ll admit that I’m not an expert on JavaScript and I wouldn’t be surprised if someone pointed out serious flaws with my code. While I make my way on the path to becoming an expert, I’ll continue to solve problems with simple solutions. Borrowing the concept Red/Green/Refactor, from &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development&quot;&gt;TDD&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it is important for developers to follow the KISS/Learn/Revise model of development. It’s impossible for me to become an expert in every field. But I should be trying to become an expert in the fields that I deal with. Just like eating an elephant, I need to learn the technologies one piece at a time. The easiest way I do that is to glean from other’s insight. It is amazing how much useful information is shared through blogs. I make it a practice to read the thoughts of the leaders in the industry several times a week. More importantly I am sharing my own thoughts. I recently &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;q=Brig+Lamoreaux&quot;&gt;searched my name&lt;/a&gt; and found that other people have found some of my solutions useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In answer to how to become an expert while keeping things simple, my solution is slow and steady, one article at a time.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <content type="html" xml:base="https://www.briglamoreaux.com/2007/07/02/keeping-the-blog-alive.html">&lt;p&gt;My daily routine involves reading several different blogs as my way of taking advantage of other people’s great ideas. Most of the things that I read are technical, but mix in with the bunch has been a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.problogger.net/&quot;&gt;blog about blogs&lt;/a&gt;. For the most part many of the articles I read are in essence a variation on the same theme. It is refreshing to find a diamond in the rough article that really helps to clarify an idea or answer a difficult question. I don’t expect this post to be a diamond, but I do plan for it to help me stay consistent with delivering my own ideas and experiences. The one piece of advice I’ve read is to keep a regular schedule of posting and that is what I’ll do.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
