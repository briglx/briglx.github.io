      <content type="html" xml:base="https://briglx.github.io/2008/10/23/ajaxworld-day-3.html">&lt;p&gt;This last day started off being able to sleep in, but it quickly went downhill when the promised breakfast arrived 45min late. Nevertheless, I did glean a few bits of good information, and only had to walk out of a few sessions. I don’t want to sound like a jerk, but some of the content of the sessions was more like an infomercial than a learning environment. Enough of my rant, on to the tidbits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;social-networks-as-a-tool&quot;&gt;Social Networks as a Tool&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We use social networks everyday to accomplish our jobs. How can we utilize the power of social networks in an computerized environment. Look at your job through the eyes of a social network. In other words, what pieces of information do individual’s own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social networks can help me as a software developer produce higher quality of code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How: Create tools that utilize the group. For instance, FxCop can produce a list of broken rules when it runs. These broken rules can be placed into a central repository. Then the entire group can access the rules and fix the code. The trick is to make it easy to select a rule, get the code, and make the fix. Bam. Almost like ants doing a little bit of work to get a big job done.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Groups are nodes. Treat group on the graph just like a regular node. It will have its own resources and connections and events. Groups can be used to manage projects&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;See Ning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;jquery---modular-code&quot;&gt;JQuery - Modular Code&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few people got their feelings hurt when &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yehudakatz.com/&quot;&gt;Yehuda Katz&lt;/a&gt; changed his presentation from an introduction to JQuery to a more advanced talk on how to write modular code with JQuery. I enjoyed the talk albeit Yehuda rushed through the talk due to his 15 minute tardiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use the Addon .listener, .intercept to bind events.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bind to a higher element than lots of lower elements&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use Event Messaging&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Think in High Level Events. Instead of e.keycode == 38 do .trigger(‘uparrow_clicked’)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;See LiveQuery. This allows you to bind events to all DIV even if they are not on the page yet. Useful for dynamic text via a widget&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;See&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;become-a-good-presenter&quot;&gt;Become a good Presenter&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walking away from this conference it was easy to spot the great presenters from the lousy ones. Great presenters do the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Prepare quality Content&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Format a clean unique presentation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Know the audience&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t repeat the exact same general information someone else already covered.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Have quality content&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t be an infomercial&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lousy presenters did basically the opposite&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Show no emotion&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mumble&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Appear as though you just saw the content&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Put lots of text on each slide&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Have misleading presentation titles in attempts to lure unsuspecting attendees&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Have poor content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s about it. I’m about to get on the plane and leave beautiful San Jose and look forward to putting to practice the real gems of the conference.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
